GUIDE = """# @NAME@: how to use this server

This server is the organisation's memory, in two parts. The **ontology** is its dictionary for data: the business entities, the exact meaning of the
words people use about them ("active", "unpaid", a plan name), how they join, what is sensitive, and the database that implements them. The
**knowledge base** is what the organisation knows from its documents: verified topic pages by subject, each fact backed by a claim with its exact quote.

## Tools
Ontology and data: `get_access` (what may I see) - `search` (find by words or codes) - `describe` (what a word means, or anything by name) -
`join_path` (how entities join) - `plan_query` (everything for one SQL statement) - `query_data` (run it, read-only).
Documents (only if your credential has collections): `library_context` (PRIMARY: whole topic pages for a question) - `library_search` (which topics
exist) - `library_topic` (one page) - `library_topic_claims` (facts with exact quotes) - `library_topic_sources` (documents behind a topic) -
`library_traverse` (related topics) - `library_source_search` / `library_source` (the verified page of each document, for detail) -
`library_vocabulary` - `library_collections`.

## Start
Call `get_access` once. Whatever it does not grant is absent from every answer: say it is withheld, never treat it as empty or zero.

## Read every question in three steps
1. **Understand the words.** People use their own words; the ontology says what they mean here. When a question turns on a business word
   (active, open, unpaid, premium, a product, plan or team name, an abbreviation) and you are not sure of its exact meaning, `describe(word)` gives the
   definition, synonyms and the filter that implements it (a word the model does not know is looked up in the documents). Use `search` when you do
   not know the name. Never assume a meaning. (For a data question you can skip this: `plan_query` resolves the words itself.)
2. **Route.**
   - What the organisation SAYS (a policy, procedure, product, plan, price, offer, eligibility rule, how-to) -> the documents: `library_context`.
   - What the data SHOWS (how many, which records, totals, rankings, a record's details) -> the data: `plan_query`, then `query_data`.
   - What something MEANS or where it lives -> the ontology: `describe`, `search`, `join_path`.
   - BOTH (a rule applied to the data: "which customers can still get a refund?", "how many accounts qualify for the premium offer?"):
     a. `library_context` for the rule and its exact conditions;
     b. the topic's `model` list names the entities it is about; `describe` a condition's words if their data meaning is unclear;
     c. `plan_query` with the question restated with those conditions, then ONE statement with `query_data`;
     d. answer with the rule (cite the topic) and the figure (name the definitions used).
3. **Answer with evidence**: topics by title, entities and columns by name, and what was withheld, pending or synthetic.

## Data questions
Only if `get_access` says data is allowed. Work like an analyst who knows SQL:
1. Map each noun of the question to the MOST SPECIFIC entity (a specific entity rather than a general one that unifies several kinds).
2. Call `plan_query` ONCE with the question and ALL the entities involved. For an overview of one record, use its entity as the grain and put every
   related entity in that same call. It returns tables, columns with exact allowed values, join keys, the definitions that apply (already
   pre-filled as filters), a runnable SQL skeleton, and the document topics about these entities.
3. Write ONE SQL statement that joins, filters, aggregates and ranks inside the database: one pre-aggregated subquery per one-to-many branch, LEFT
   JOINed on the grain key (the skeleton shows how). Apply ONLY the filters the question asks for and the definitions provide: never add status or
   scope filters of your own (such as restricting to 'active' records). Never run several small queries and combine their results yourself. A record
   you only know by name is filtered by name in the same statement (the skeleton's WHERE comment shows how): do not run a separate query for its id.
4. Run it with `query_data`, then answer from the result. If it errors, the error says where the column really lives: fix and retry.

## Document questions
Call `library_context` with the question. If `answerable` is false, the documents do not cover it: say so and do not answer from your own knowledge
(first try once more if the question used a company word: `describe` it, or `library_search` with other words). Base the answer on the returned
pages; for the exact quote of a fact use `library_topic_claims`; for a detail a page lacks use `library_source_search` / `library_source`. Never guess
slugs: use only those the tools returned. If topics conflict, say so first. Results are grouped by collection and never mixed. Every collection is
`public` (may be shared with customers) or `internal` (for your own understanding: never quote it or refer to it when talking with customers);
that tag is on every result, obey it.

## How to answer
- Name the entities and columns you used. Say when an item is `pending_confirmation` (not confirmed by the team), and when a definition is only a
  `working` reading.
- Say when data is synthetic, or when a figure is indicative because the model marks its definition as pending confirmation.
- Do not invent entities, columns, joins, example values, rules or facts: only report what the tools returned. Results carry a `next` hint: follow it.
- Never search for restricted data (identity numbers, credentials and the like): state that it is not available.
- Links marked optional or unreliable can be empty: a missing link is not evidence that the related thing does not exist. Say so when your path uses one.
